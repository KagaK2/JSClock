### JS Clock

This is a Clock made from HTML, CSS and Javascript. This app's main purpose is for the Javascript club at [The Shortcut](https://theshortcut.org/).

This Clock is also a part of the Javascript 30 made by Wes Bos. Check out the course at https://javascript30.com/

#### Installation

This app can be run with Live Server in the Code Editor or run directly in the browser by open the `index.html` file

#### Quick guide

The first step is to create a `HTML` file with some empty `div` elements for the clock styling.

The second step is adding the CSS styling so that the `div` elements can resemble parts of a clock. Check out the file and take notice of some comments about the rotation and the angle of the clock's hands.

The last step makes a js function to move the hands after each seconds. We move the hands by changing the hands' `transform` property.
